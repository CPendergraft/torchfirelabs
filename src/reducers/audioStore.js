Its a live work community of cool ass folks trying to make life a little closer to art then reality. Me and my folks threw tons of parties and we just lucky and blessed very few people ever got hurt. What happened this weekend really hit me hard. I hope that we can learn something and find some comfort in the love that we have for each other. We all have so little time, and to me it is especially tragic when young people are lost. \n\nMusic and performance ©2016 Chris Pendergraft",

I hear music in my head and give it voice. Its just that simple. So as you go through my cloud, you will hear music from many genres, because I feel many things. We are all the same. We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",

I'd rather not dig any deeper on lyrical meaning here. I think that we have these moments, that define who we are in the end, but if we look to hard at the past, we miss the moment we are in, and we get into a routine of life. It's a certain comfort we have, but we need to be open to the world, and that may require going out of our comfort zone, to explore the world.\n\nthey used to have something\nthat was perfect\nin every way\nnot because \nthey were strangers\nbecause they always knew \njust what to say\n\nand we\nwonder in silence\nwhere will time take us\nNow that we’ve given up the wheel\nfor there\nOnce was a time when \nall that we needed \nwas here\n\nwhat’s lost is lost\nit is smoke in the air\nThe perfect note  \nthat hangs just right\nthat fills the midnight air\nwhat’s lost is lost\nit is smoke in the air\nThe perfect note  \nthat hangs just right\nthat fills the midnight air\n\nI must tell you something\ncuz I want the whole\nworld to know\nAint no one \nin this big big world\nWho could give me\nsuch a  perfect love\nand we\nwonder in silence\nwhere will time take us\nNow that we’ve given up the wheel\nfor there\nOnce was atime when \nall that we needed \nwas here",

We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram.

She was one of the closest friends that I ever had; she always had my heart in mind, she was always there for me, for 20 years we spoke on the phone almost every day. I find it so hard to lose her, and I miss her so much I just can't even explain. If she can hear me she knows that this song comes from love. \nShe was really something special. 100% free spirit and I mean that in the\u0010 best way possible, for she loved so many. Her smile could light up your day like a sunbeam. At her funeral there was over 1000 people. She was made of light. She worked on her own cars, she always helped others with what ever she could. She loved country music. She was my friend.\n\nAlways Knew Just What To Say\nwords and music by Chris Pendergraft\n\nEveryday, cross my mind\nlike a sunrise in my\u0010 kitchen\nYou were always\nright on time\nyou always knew \njust what to say\n\nAnd I miss you\nbut somehow \nI know \nthat you know\nAnd it kills me\nbut I know \nyou knew \nthat you \nhad to go\n\nLet me tell you about a girl made of light\nFrom the forest north western side\ngive her last dollar if you ask her for a dime\nAnd on her heart\nno man could put a price\nno man could put a price\n",

            "description": "©2016 words music and art by Chris Pendergraft\na dedication to the artist who taught me to sing, in a way my first real 'fan' band that I followed. \nDuring his last show, Prince told the audience \"I am okay, don't waste your prayers on me\"  This really struck me. I heard this melody the day he died, and I sat down today and tracked the drums and everything else. Van Jones was Prince's friend, and he spoke about him in very personal terms the other day, and it move me to tears. Prince was a philanthropic person, and did his work under secrecy. This really moved me, he was so ON and still he looked beyond him self to help others. I hope Van and his other close friends can find the peace that passes understanding.\n\nSo the song is about all of our loss, and the idea that maybe for a moment Prince would get to see, like his impact on the world, because the music he brought us made us think and feel, a myriad of different feelings, because he reveled his inner struggles and victories through each beat, note and lyric. He was a fucking master. There can not be another Prince. Right now all over the planet, people are dancing, crying, laughing, going crazy; because of his courage to find himself in his music and encourage us to find our inner rockstar, even if its just when we are in the car, pumping the jams. God Bless Prince Rogers Nelson. \n\nThe World You Taught To Sing (For Prince)\nNow that you’ve gone\nYou know this world\nit is a harder   place \nBut you’ve left so much behind\nWe’ve been \nblessed \neach and \nevery day \n\nNow you rise up\nAbove the clouds\nFor now you are Free\nyes you are \nto see \nthe love that \nyou bring\nTo all those \nin the world\nthat you\nhave taught to \nsing \nand tonight they \nsing\nDon't Waste No Prayers,\nNo Prayers on me\nCuz now I am free\nDon't Waste No Prayers,\nNo Prayers on me\nCuz now I am free",

We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine.

We kinda cut our teeth together, wrote many records together and I hope we can make a full album together in the future. Danny is one of my closest friends and although he lives in so cal, we stay in touch and always have. I was fantastic to see him and play together again.  If you know my playing you can hear his influence in every note on the bass and how I approach arrangement and feel. \n\nThis song is heavy duty Rootbeer, our original band, and when I wrote the original arrangement I had Dr. D in mind. So cool he showed up when he did. \n\n©2016 Chris Pendergraft music and lyrics. \nbass arrangement and performance by dr. danny simon. \nLyrics to come. ",

Echo and panning done in post. \nFender jazz bass, Pearl traveler drums. Written in 6/8 at 72 bpm, Key of B major.  Second act 6/8 at 160 bpm. Fender twin on lead for second section. \n\nJimi Hendrix has had a significant impact on my thinking. If you are familiar with my work, you may already know that. This is the first slow blues I have ever recorded or released. When I got electric lady land my mind changed with what music could be, and even when I write classical he is sitting with me, teaching me. I really never made another connection like that in music, maybe to Debussy, but Jimi moves me, spiritually, in a musical way that's unique. I offer nothing but respect for his impact on my playing, I thank him, his family and his fans world wide for keeping Jimi's music alive year after year. Peace.",

Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",

            "description": "Produced and mixed by Russell Sinfield @russell-sinfield- thank you Russell!\nA few weeks ago I was thinking about if Jimi Hendrix were around looking at the political system and what he might have to say about it. He was a brilliant lyricist and found a cool way of telling story\u0010s about people and the inner mind of those people. I look at him living in a very divisive time and leading a very non-divisive existence. So with much respect do I put this track out, to Jimi and his fans, Jimi straight up taught me how to look at guitar, and think with songs.  So  much love to Jimi and to his family. I did the painting of Jimi last week as I messed around with  guitar work. I hope y'all can dig on it. \nCheers\nwords, music, performance, and artwork\n©2016 Chris Pendergraft\n\nLook at all these jokers\nJust trying to play that  game\nThey got Stuntmen , props and posters \nThe politics of hate\nForget the children\nOf the war on povery\nThey got can drives, \nChristmas cards and hustlers\nThe propaganda of today\neach and every day\n\n\tBefore you say it ain’t on me\n\twhen you turn away\n\twe walk away \n\ton chaging  \n\n\tWhat do you think \n\tthat hates gonna bring you\n\twhen everybody knows \n \tit takes love \n\tto make us safe\n\tDont get your self all \n\tcaught up \n\tand confused \n\tthe more things change \n\tthe more \n\tthey stay \n\tthe same\n\nLook at all these children\njust trying to make their way\nthey got airstrikes, morterfire\nand carbombs \nthe politics of hate\nForget Alepo\nThey say its gone\nThey say its gone\n today\nThey got  hospitals,\nhumans and bandaids\ngetting darker everyday\neach and everyday \n\n\tBefore you say it ain’t on me\n\twhen you turn away\n\twe walk away \n\ton chaging  \n\n\tWhat do you think \n\tthat hates gonna bring you\n\twhen everybody knows \n \tit takes love \n\tto make us safe\n\tDont get your self all \n\tcaught up \n\tand confused \n\tthe more things change \n\tthe more \n\tthey stay \n\tthe same\n\nLook at all these people\njust trying to have their say\nThey got voter fraud, supression, \nand harassment\nThe politics of change\nForget tomorrow\nWe got to deal with this today\nWe got shooters, hackers\nand con-men\nTaking our voices away\neach and everyday \n\t\n\tBefore you say it ain’t on me\n\twhen you turn away\n\twe walk away \n\ton chaging  \n\n\tWhat do you think \n\tthat hates gonna bring you\n\twhen everybody knows \n \tit takes love \n\tto make us safe\n\tDont get your self all \n\tcaught up \n\tand confused \n\tthe more things change \n\tthe more \n\tthey stay \n\tthe same",

We are working on a record of tracks inspired by hendrix and this song\n\"Nation of Deception\" is our best to date, Russell Sinfield killed it on guitar and producers it and mixed it- I sent him dry tracks and that is how much I trust this dude! He brought some sick ass guitar work and we have a mega duel as the song goes on. I got nothing but respect for Jimi and I hope y'all can feel this. \nIllustration by Chris Pendergraft http://torchfirelabs.com/\n\nNation of Confusion \n\nPeople know it best\nas a feeling of confusion \na place in thought\nmade of nothing but despair\nBut the fool know \nIt not where you're at\nbut where you are going\nthat proves if the jokes on them\nor if it's been on you\n\nNation of Deception \nWhat is your direction\nYou've gone too far too far to see\nNation of Deception \nWhat is your intention\nYou've gone too far too far to see",

I really enjoy hanging with him online and over the last few months we have been working on some songs. This is a tune I knew he would contribute some amazing guitar work to. \r\nAfter i heard it it  I said \"wow\" and he kindly said \"I wanted to make it hard to see where I came in or what I did\"\r\nOne of the amazing  THINGS I have found in collaboration is how people check their egos at the door for the song, if you really want to serve the tune. It's a huge thing for me to figure out, being such a control freak, and such an isolationist in my personal life. I'm still working on it. \r\nWell this song is about just what it soundS  like, about loss, and continuing after loss. We all will face it, and we all must continue.\r\n\r\nThe Good Ones\r\nLife is not fare\r\nwhat more can she say\r\nBut you’ve so much love\r\nIm sure you’ll do okay\r\nShe closes the window\r\nTurns out the light\r\nKisses her daughter\r\ntells her goodnight\r\n\r\nSometime life it takes the good ones\r\nTakes them far from our lives\r\nNo matter how deep our wisdom\r\nWe will never know just why\r\n\r\nShe goes down the stairs \r\nTurns out the light\r\nKIssess  his picture\r\nThen starts to cry\r\nLife can't be easy\r\nBut why is it so hard\r\nShe feels so empty\r\nBut she must carry on\r\n\r\n",

I hear music in my head and give it voice. Its just that simple. So as you go through my cloud, you will hear music from many genres, because I feel many things. We are all the same. We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",

I hear music in my head and give it voice. Its just that simple. So as you go through my cloud, you will hear music from many genres, because I feel many things. We are all the same. We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",

Thanks for listening...\n\nSo about the song. Many of you may know, or guess that I struggle, keeping my mind in the 'real world'. I am a daze, in most moments of my day, I have a family and must remain in the game, for my survival and my childrens' depends on it, so I work as an software engineer. \nI make all kinds of junk. I drive in a car, I sit in a cube, I swipe a card I open the door, rinse wash repeat. Drone. \nBut my head is never there, it's in a constant creative flow, as i draw of the energy of a billion neurons and make a little part of the world, my part, more honest, more pure, more beautiful.\nSo this dichotomy of drone and artisan, painter and poet, hopeless idealist, taxpayer, is always in conflict. Thus, my struggle. I am lucky the muse screams at me, but it is tough to find balance at all. It is not a real struggle, as it is self imposed. I can and always have done both, as I must, keep my feet on the ground and my head in the stars, always trying to find the big picture and apply it to the smallest parts of my limited reality. \nSo the song is about the above conflict, of looking at life on a macro, and living in the micro. \nguess I gotta pay my taxes.

I spend a lot of time painting mythology, and I imagined the meeting of Hercules and Atlas similar to a carny caller trying to lure the young strongman up to ring a bell. So of course you will hear some Rocky Horror in here, as that was what I was shooting for. I Love the Ziggy period of Bowies life and I must tell you I have listened to a lot of bowie lately. \nI imagined the verses as Atlas and the chorus as Hercules who could not even understand why he would continue to carry the world. \nForgotten Titan no more. \n\nSo here it is I hope you dig it- xx00xx Chris",

As crazy as things have gotten as of late in the United States and around the world this song has stuck in my head like a mantra. I hope you can dig the more modern arrangement and I hope to not offend anyone in that way, as some consider this sacred. \nI also paid homage for a few measures to Jimi Hendrix, as he is considered to have the definitive version. I must agree, but I also love Dylan's original, but my generation needs this track as much as any previous, and I imagine that it will be covered from here till the end of time. \nMuch love and respect and I hope you can all dig it. \nRecorded August 4th 2016, in Echocosmic studios. All instruments recorded and performed by myself. ",

I hear music in my head and give it voice. Its just that simple. So as you go through my cloud, you will hear music from many genres, because I feel many things. We are all the same. We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",

                "description": "Thank you for your support-\nover 2.7 million plays - \nChris Pendergraft of the bands:\nBATU KURA KURA\nEchoCosmic (electro-garage)\nTorchfire Heart (Space Rock)\n@cowboy_mystics(mystic garage)\n@earthmother-one(deep funk)\n@the-night-kitchen(night music)\n@the-lovable-reprobates(progrock)\n@batu_kura_kura (stoner-doom rock) \n@imperialhoney (electro pop)\n\nI am lucky to have music in my life, as well as art. I hear music in my head and give it voice. Its just that simple. So as you go through my cloud, you will hear music from many genres, because I feel many things. We are all the same. We are all working this all out in different ways, from different places. That connection to each other can be felt, like the wind, but it is unseen, so if a song reaches out to you, reach out to me. I am just a person trying to work it all out.\nAll my music is free, unless you find it on iTunes, but some albums are only there so if you dont have any money let me know what record you want and ill send it to you. \nSo I paint, and I do the art for all the bands I write for, and a whole lot of other bands, so I am blessed because art is divine. Anyway, if you want to book one of my bands, or whatever, want to sing one of my songs (they are all open to that) just reach out to me on Facebook or instagram. Send me a mail if you need me to support your track here on soundcloud, or if you need art for your music. Bless you.",
